## 📡 I'm Gabriel de Azeredo, an undergraduate student at IFSC/USP.

I'm currently studying for a bachelor's degree in computational physics and working in undergraduate research with the Astroparticle Physics group. 

### 🌌 Astrophysics

My research primarily centers on the propagation of particles through the Universe. I have interest in multi-messenger astrophysics: ultra-high energy cosmic rays, gamma rays and neutrinos.

- 🔭 **Current project:** UHECR propagation with potential dark sector interaction.
- 🪐 **Past project:** Extragalactic ultra-high energy proton propagation.
- 🚀 **Other Topics of Interest:** Particle acceleration mechanisms in astrophysics, cosmic rays sources and indirect search for dark matter.

### 💻 Programming

- **Languages:** Julia, C++, Fortran.
- **Tools:** Python and its popular libs, shell script, linux.
