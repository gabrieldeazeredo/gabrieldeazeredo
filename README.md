## 🛰️ Hi, there! I'm Gabriel de Azeredo, an undergraduate student at IFSC/USP.

I'm currently studying for a bachelor's degree in computational physics and working in undergraduate research with the Astroparticle Physics group. 

### 🌌 Astrophysics

My research primarily centers on investigating the propagation of particles through the Universe. I have interest in multi-messenger astrophysics on high energy scale: UHECR, gamma rays and neutrines. 

- 🔭 Current Project: Ultra-high energy cosmic rays propagation.
- 🚀 Research interests: Ultra-high energy cosmic rays sources, numerical methods for astroparticle propagation.

### 💻 Programming

- **Languages:** Julia, C++, Fortran.
- **Tools:** Python and its popular libs, shell script.
