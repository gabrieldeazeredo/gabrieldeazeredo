## 🛰️ Hi, there! I'm Gabriel de Azeredo, an undergraduate student at IFSC/USP.

I'm currently studying for a bachelor's degree in computational physics and working in undergraduate research with the Astroparticle Physics group. 

### 🌌 Astrophysics

My research primarily centers on investigating the propagation of particles through the Universe. I have interest in multi-messenger astrophysics: ultra-high energy cosmic rays, gamma rays and neutrines.

- 🔭 **Current project:** UHECR propagation with potential dark sector interaction.
- 🪐 **Past project:** Proton propagation by Monte Carlo method and numerical approach.
- 🚀 **Other Topics of Interest:** Particle acceleration mechanisms in astrophysics, UHECR sources.

### 💻 Programming

- **Languages:** Julia, C++, Fortran.
- **Tools:** Python and its popular libs, shell script.
